# Personal Expense Tracker (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **console-based Personal Expense Tracker** written in **Python**. The project is **currently a work in progress** and is being developed to strengthen my understanding of **file handling, data processing, and basic application design** using Python.

The application allows users to record daily expenses, view stored data, and analyze spending patterns using a CSV file for persistence.

## 🚧 Project Status

**Status:** ⏳ *In Progress*

Core functionality has been implemented, while additional improvements and refinements are planned. This repository reflects an **active learning project**, not a finished production system.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are to:

* Practice **Python file I/O** using CSV files
* Build a menu-driven console application
* Apply data aggregation and basic analysis techniques
* Improve code structure, validation, and usability over time

---

## 🧩 Current Features

The expense tracker currently supports:

* Creating and initializing an expense CSV file
* Adding expenses with:

  * Date (manual or default to current date)
  * Category
  * Amount
* Viewing all recorded expenses
* Analyzing total spending and spending per category
* Clearing:

  * All stored data
  * Data for a specific category
  * In-memory analysis results

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Used

* **Python 3**
* File handling (`csv`, `os`)
* Dictionaries and data aggregation
* Input validation and error handling
* Console-based user interface
